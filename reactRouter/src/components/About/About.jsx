                            React is an open-source JavaScript library.  It is sometimes referred to as React.js or ReactJS. In programming, libraries serve as toolkits for developers. Their contents may include configuration data, prewritten code, and message templates. A React developer uses their programming skills to create JavaScript-based applications for web or mobile environments. They typically specialize in front-end development, such as building user interfaces (UI).
